# Azure DevOps Work Items Creator

A Node.js tool to bulk create Azure DevOps work items from JSON data. This tool helps automate the creation of Product Backlog Items and Features in Azure DevOps, with support for setting titles, states, tags, and more.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 14.0.0
- Azure CLI installed and configured
- Access to Azure DevOps

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd azure-devops-work-items-creator
```

2. Install dependencies (if any are added in the future):
```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

The tool uses the following configuration (found in `create-work-items.js`):

- Organization: `https://msazure.visualstudio.com`
- Project: `One`
- Area Path: `One\LogAnalytics\QueryService`
- Iteration Path: `One\Bromine\CY25Q3\Monthly\07 Jul (Jun 29 - Jul 26)`

Update these constants in the script if needed.

## Usage

The tool provides two ways to run:

1. **Dry Run Mode** (default) - Preview what work items would be created:
```bash
npm start
# or
node main.js
```

2. **Create Mode** - Actually create the work items:
```bash
npm run create
# or
node main.js --apply
```

## Epic Hierarchy

The tool automatically creates an Epic hierarchy:

```
[Draft->LAQS] /search (Root Epic)
└── [Draft->LAQS] Activity Log /query (Child Epic)
    └── Work items with "AL" tag
└── Work items with "UI /search" tag (if they don't have "AL" tag)
```

**Parent Assignment Rules:**
- Items with "AL" tag → Parent is "[Draft->LAQS] Activity Log /query" Epic
- Items with only "UI /search" tag → Parent is "[Draft->LAQS] /search" Epic  
- Items with both tags → Parent is "[Draft->LAQS] Activity Log /query" Epic (higher priority)
- Items with neither tag → No parent Epic

## Data Format

Work items are created based on data in `table_data.json`. The file should contain an array of objects with the following structure:

```json
{
  "queryPipelineData": [
    {
      "Feature": "Feature name",
      "/search from UI": "+",
      "DGrep shim": "+",
      "Activity Log (/query)": "+",
      "Effort (S/M/L)": "S",
      "Progress": "In progress"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Fields:

- **Feature**: Name of the work item (required)
- **Effort (S/M/L)**: Size of the work item (required)
  - "S" creates a Product Backlog Item
  - "M" or "L" creates a Feature
- **Progress**: Current state of the work item
  - Empty → "New"
  - "Done" or "Mostly done" → "Done"
  - "In progress", "Not done", "Partial" → "Active"
- Other fields are used for tag generation:
  - "+` in "/search from UI" adds "UI /search" tag
  - "+" in "DGrep shim" adds "shim" tag
  - "+" in "Activity Log (/query)" adds "AL" tag
